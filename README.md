## 💭 Technological Landscape

With the prevalence of artifical intelligence, the opportunities for discovering new technological capabilities have sprouted. Open AI has conformed to the general public by allowing contribution for their open source platform - Whisper AI. This implementation will spark a crescendo, reverberating the impacts of unbounded technological indulgence. Albeit this decision may seem perilous at best, individual's akin to myself will be able to contribute significant and relevant discoveries into the scope of artifical intelligence.

## 🔒 Security

**_All files and relavent data is kept anonymous and secured._**
